# Model Training

This directory contains resources for training and fine-tuning the vehicle detection model.

## 📓 Notebooks

- `train-vehicle-detector.ipynb`: The primary Jupyter notebook for training the YOLOv8 model locally.

## 🌐 Online Training

For GPU-accelerated training, use the Kaggle notebook:
👉 [Train Vehicle Detector on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/emammame/train-vehicle-detector)

## 🛠️ Instructions

1.  Open the local notebook using Jupyter Lab or VS Code.
2.  Ensure you have the required datasets (configured within the notebook).
3.  Follow the steps to train and export the model to `.pt` or `.onnx` formats.
4.  Saved models should be moved to the `Ml_codes/models/` directory.
